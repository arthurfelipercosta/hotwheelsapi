        "en-us": "Hot Shots was an extremely short-lived series of motorized cars and dragsters produced during the Redline era from 1972 to 1973 . The selling point of the castings was their use of RipFire motors, which were essentially extremely powerful ripcord motors allowing for the castings to wheelie and burnout. The cars, advertised as \"Power racers with RipFire motors\", were also purportedly able to spark as they burned out. While the series was manufactured by Mattel and feature wheels also used on Hot Wheels products these were not officially branded as Hot Wheels products.",
