        "en-us": "LionChief is an entry-level product line manufactured by Lionel, LLC . Trains in this line are O gauge trains done to semi-scale proportions, featuring reduced detailing compared to Lionel's other offerings and a simpler control system using a plastic handheld remote; trains in this scale are incompatible with Lionel's other command control systems. Later iterations of the system, known as LionChief Plus and LionChief Plus 2.0 , feature improved functionality, with the latter being compatible with Lionel's TMCC control system while retaining all of LionChief's other features.",
