        "en-us": "RRRumblers was a fairly short-lived series of Hot Wheels 1:32 scale motorbikes produced during the Redline era from 1971 to 1973 . The selling point of the motorbikes was their ability to run on Hot Wheels track. Each came with a Track-Rack (a \"carriage\" with 2 or 4 small transparent wheels) which allowed them to run on Hot Wheels track; the stand could be removed and the motorbikes displayed on their own with their kickstands down.",
