            "en-us": "Robo Wheels (ロボウィール) was a short-lived series of transforming cars similar to toys like Transformers and GoBots . Designed as 1/64 scaled cars released under the Hot Wheels branding, they can easily be transformed into little skate-boarding robots, capitalizing on the late-'90s X-Sports craze. The bottom deck of the car is cast in diecast metal, while the articulated robots and car parts are plastic. The body of the robots make up the engine, and the body parts of the cars attach to the arms or legs. With multiple cars, one can easily customize their Robo Wheels to create the perfect fighter.",
