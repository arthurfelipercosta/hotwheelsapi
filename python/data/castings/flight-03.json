The car was conceived \"following an unhappy experience\" attempting to license a mildly modified Acura Integra show car which ultimately was never produced. In development the casting was given the placeholder name of \" My Tuna \", described by designer Mark Jones as a \"goofy working name\"; he also had some input in the graphic for the casting's first release.",
