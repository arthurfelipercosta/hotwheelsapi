Produced on GM's A-body platform, the Chevelle was one of Chevrolet's most successful marques. The car's name is speculated to be a combination between \"gazelle\" and \"Chevrolet\", with Chevrolet seemingly positioning this car as a smaller version of the Impala . The car was introduced in August 1963 by Chevrolet CEO Bunkie Knudsen as the Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu , for it was essentially a performance version of the Malibu.",
