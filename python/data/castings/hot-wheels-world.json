        "en-us": "Hot Wheels World sets, which began selling in 1997 as the successor to Street Traxx , Sto & Go and Hot Wheels Auto City , are part of a Hot Wheels track system designed to look like a futuristic city. They have track called \"E-Z Snap\" that is used for making the owner's track their dream city. From 1997 to around 1999, the sets made were normal and realistic with some stunt elements sprinkled in, then around 2000, sets like the Powershift Garage and Crash Test started the trend of Hot Wheels World-compatible sets focusing on stunts and crashes more than an actual city.",
