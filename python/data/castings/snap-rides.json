        "en-us": "Snap Rides was a short-lived series of Hot Wheels cars produced in 2015. The selling point of the cars are the various wheelsets, parts and engines that could be snapped onto the cars and their chassis. Due to poor sales, the series did not continue beyond 2015; it is likely due to these poor sales that a number of the cars shown below are likely to have never been released. A derivative series known as Super Snap Rides was also developed around the same time.",
