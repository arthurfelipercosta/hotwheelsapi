            "en-us": "The Super California Custom series was released by Mattel in 1991. It consists of twelve models (six different castings). The cars are similar to the Hi-Rakers series of the 1980's where the rear axles can be raised to equip a pair of big rubber wheels. When the axle is raised, the front engine pops up. Each package comes with a set of decals and a plastic ramp, car jack or engine hoist.",
