        "en-us": "Chicane Debut series AcceleRacers: Teku Produced 2005 - Present Designer Jun Imai Number G8091\\n\\nChicane is an original design by Jun Imai that debuted under the Teku segment of the AcceleRacers series in 2005 . It depicts a technologically modified rally coupe with 400HP, a Mid Engine Rocket set-up, 6.5 liter DOHC, lightened chassis, carbon fiber body, one-piece windshield, black-chrome 18\" front wheels, and 22\" back wheels. The name of this model is derived from its proposed ability to navigate through \"chicanes\" (a notch in a straightaway). This casting was retooled in 2013 with part of the base cast into the body, and in 2014 with a post-post design.",
