For all intents and purposes the car was essentially a rebadged version of the Plymouth Duster and was available with four engine options, those being two Slant-6s and two V8s. The car was originally planned to be named the Beaver but this was changed after it was found that the word had a crude meaning in some circles. 79,959 were produced for 1971.",
