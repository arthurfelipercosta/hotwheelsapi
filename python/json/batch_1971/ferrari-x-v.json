            "en-us": "Ferrari X-V was a short-lived series of Hot Wheels cars that was released in 2005 only. This was an offshoot of the Motorized X-V Racers series. As with the normal series, the cars are charged by a Power Base Booster, but in this series it was known as the X-V Power Booster. The X-V Power Booster is significantly larger than the standard Power Base Booster and is only compatible with cars from the series. The series attempted to celebrate Ferrari design by merging Ferrari design with futuristic concepts. The \"X-V\" in this case stood for \" X treme V elociti\".",
