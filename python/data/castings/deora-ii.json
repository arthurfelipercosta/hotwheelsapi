        "en-us": "Deora II is a modernized take on the Deora show car designed by Harry Bradley. Although it has the same trappings of the original Deora, such as a pair of surfboards and a two-seater cabin with a roof-hinged, front-mounted door, the Deora II is updated with a supercharged V8 and a swooping, curved body that contrasts the original Deora's sharp, angled lines. Comparisons can be drawn between the bubble-esque canopy and the rear of a third-generation Ford Taurus station wagon. \n\nThe casting has been retooled twice; first in 2011, to greatly sink the windows into the frame, and then again in 2021, molding the previously detachable surfboards into the body. A similarly molded plastic retool had previously debuted in 2011, for Color Shifters, although it maintains the original window position.  \n\nDeora II starred as car #01 of the Highway 35 anniversary event, driven by the Wave Rippers team leader Josef \"Vert\" Wheeler. The very same car would later go on to appear (and be destroyed) in AcceleRacers. Initially, this Deora II was rated at 400 horsepower with a 4.4 liter engine; by the time of AcceleRacers, these numbers had been increased to 750 horsepower and 5.0 liters.",
