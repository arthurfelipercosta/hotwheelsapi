            "en-us": "The Fast & Furious Premium Series is a series of Hot Wheels vehicles replicating real-life cars from the Fast & Furious film franchise. Unlike the 'Basic' Fast & Furious Series , these vehicles have detailed tampos, metal bases and Real Riders wheels. The series was dropped for 2022, with Fast & Furious -themed Premium releases being put under the Replica Entertainment banner, before returning for 2023 using essentially the same release scheme as the previous year (i.e. with no specific theming or series).",
