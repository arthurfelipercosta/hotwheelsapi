            "en-us": "The Heavyweights were a series of futuristic trucks in 1970 and 1971 designed predominately by Ira Gilford and sometimes with the help of Larry Wood. They used three different bodies with a plastic attachment on the back. Once the plastic attachment is missing, they are indistinguishable from each other. Most of the plastic attachments, glass and interiors have been reproduced.",
