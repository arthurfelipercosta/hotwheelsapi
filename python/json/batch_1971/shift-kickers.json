            "en-us": "Shift Kickers was a short-lived series of Hot Wheels cars produced only in 1983. The selling point of the cars was their \"stick shift\" action; each of the cars had a comically oversized shifter which sort of acted as a handbrake. Pulling back the handle locks the wheels in place and makes the car unable to move; pushing the handle forwards allows the car to go. The series was discontinued in 1984.",
