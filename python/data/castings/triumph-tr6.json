Styled by Wilhelm Karmann GmbH of Germany, the TR6 was one of the first UK cars of the British Leyland era, a time marked by strikes, shoddy workmanship and highly unreliable cars. It was powered by a 2.5L inline-6 mated to a 4-speed manual. 91,850 were produced from 1968 to 1976, with the vast majority of TR6s being exported to the United States. It would be replaced with the TR7 , noted for its wedged shape as styled by Harris Mann.",
