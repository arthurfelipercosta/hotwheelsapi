            "en-us": "Speed Machines were a line of vehicles released by Mattel in 1983 to compete with other lower cost diecast brands. They consisted of Hot Wheels castings with a few cost cutting features, such as plastic bases, no chrome apart from the wheels, and simple enamel paint.  All were made in Malaysia and had standard basic wheels .  None of the packages carried a unique toy #, the vehicle name, or the Hot Wheels logo (only the Mattel logo).  The package was smaller than the standard size and did carry Assortment # 4249, 4227-0910, the back of the card was the same for all.",
