The NSX was Honda's first Supercar and in North America was launched under the Acura brand name, which was created to give Honda's more prestigious models a better image. The NSX's bodywork was constructed out of aluminum, which shaved a great deal of weight from the car. As of 2017, this is the oldest model of Acura made by Hot Wheels.",
