        "en-us": "Zowees were a series of very small (1/125 scale) Hot Wheels vehicles produced in 1972. There were 8 different vehicles which were originally made for Shell Oil Company as a promotional item which one would receive after fueling up their car, or they could be purchased from the station for $0.49; these were packaged in baggies. After the promotion for Shell, slightly different versions of the original eight and an additional six new vehicles were released and were only available through retail shops. Zowees were made up of a metal piece which was the base and engine, to which the plastic body and wheels would clip in to.",
