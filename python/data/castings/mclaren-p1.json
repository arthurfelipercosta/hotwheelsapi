        "en-us": "The McLaren P1 is a limited-production high-performance hybrid sports car produced by McLaren Automotive. Designed by Frank Stephenson, Paul Howse and Rob Melville, the P1 was unveiled at the 2012 Paris Auto Show and acted as McLaren's halo car, it being considered by the press as the successor to the F1; each unit cost $1.15 million. The car is powered by a 3.8L McLaren M838TQ twin-turbocharged V8 along with a McLaren E-Motor electric motor mated to a 7-speed dual clutch; the car produces a combined power output of 903 horsepower. The car features a number of Formula One-derived features such as an instant power assist system and a drag reduction system incorporated into the car's rear wing, which is usually extended. Production began in October 2013 and ended in December 2015, with 375 units produced to \"maintain exclusivity\".",
