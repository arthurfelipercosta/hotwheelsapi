Initially powered by a Volkswagen 2.0L GDI inline-4, this was later changed to a Ford EcoBoost engine. The MXR appears to represent a specific version of the MXT, featuring a new wing and the new EcoBoost engine. Production ended in 2014 due to apparent financial mismanagement from one of Mastretta's financiers, putting their Toluca plant on standby and making 45 employees redundant.",
