            "en-us": "X-V Racers was a short-lived series of Hot Wheels cars produced from 1986 to 1987. These were essentially the successors of the Scorchers castings, with gyro-powered motors. The castings had to be run around the ground for some time, and could balance on their backs due to the gyroscopes in them. X-V Racers were geared to run more slowly than the Scorchers. The X-V apparently stood for \"e X perimental V ehicle\".",
