            "en-us": "Mastretta MXR Debut series HW Race - Thrill Racers Produced 2014 - Present Designer Ryu Asada Number BDD05\\n\\nThe Mastretta MXT was a low-volume production Mexican sports car produced by Mastretta Cars from 2011 to 2014. Initially powered by a Volkswagen 2.0L GDI inline-4, this was later changed to a Ford EcoBoost engine. The MXR appears to represent a specific version of the MXT, featuring a new wing and the new EcoBoost engine. Production ended in 2014 due to apparent financial mismanagement from one of Mastretta's financiers, putting their Toluca plant on standby and making 45 employees redundant.",
