            "en-us": "Hot Wheels Railroad was a very short-lived series of model trains intended to be compatible with Hot Wheels vehicles. These were produced from 1983 to 1985 and were approximately 1/64 scale. The trains were advertised as being \"kid-powered\" and were compatible with a proprietary type of Hot Wheels track; this track was similar to HO scale track and these trains can work on regular HO scale track. All locomotives were based on real-life trains and featured authentic liveries mimicking real-life railroads.",
