        "en-us": "Flippers (later Flashmagic Flippers , conceptualized as Flipside Wheels ) was a series that debuted in 1990 . All castings were designed by Lionel , originally released as \"Lionel Revolvers\" in years prior. All models were made and manufactured by Chief Industrial Co. out of China. The series was pitched to Hot Wheels rather than a formal collaboration using a hand-drawn pitch board and mock-up prototype. Mattel omitted licensed insignias from all tampo graphics before release under Hot Wheels branding. In 1991 Mattel retooled a single model to include lights and sounds with a non-rechargeable battery for three releases and changed the name of the series to Flashmagic Flippers.",
