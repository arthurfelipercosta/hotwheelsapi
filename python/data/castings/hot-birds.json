        "en-us": "Hot Birds was a very short-lived series of model airplanes. These were produced in 1971 and were approximately 1/64 scale. These were futuristic aircraft painted in Spectraflame colors. Despite sharing a similar name and using Hot Wheels-style paint this series was not officially branded as a Hot Wheels product. Hot Birds are notably expensive to acquire today. The Sky Busters line could be seen as a spiritual successor to this series, although said series consists entirely of repackaged Matchbox castings.",
