        "en-us": "Scorchers were a range of spring-powered Hot Wheels vehicles designed by Mike McKittrick and others introduced in 1979 . They were not the first motorized cars produced by Hot Wheels; the rechargeable battery-powered Sizzlers had been introduced in 1969 (although these were not diecast), and the clunky rubber-band powered Revvers dated from 1973. However, the Scorchers were the first powered diecast cars that actually worked convincingly.",
