        "en-us": "Formula Fuelers was a short-lived series of oversized battery-operated Hot Wheels cars and motorcycles which ran from 2004 to 2005. The Formula Fuelers were unique in that these cars were \"powered\" by what Hot Wheels called \"Nitrox 2 \" fitted in canisters which would be plugged into the cars; the idea here was that kids could mix whatever liquids they had from orange juice to coke and place them in the canister to see how far the car would go. Each car came with a number of Nitrox 2 -branded packets, filled with \"tablets\" and \"liquid\". When the canister was plugged in, a button on the vehicle could be pressed and the vehicle would go; the cars were advertised as being able to go faster \"the better you mix\", encouraging kids to experiment. The cars and motorcycles are approximately 1/24 scale, with the 2004 Racers and the 2005 Sky Force, bar the Motos, having sound effects and playing them as the vehicle moved along.",
