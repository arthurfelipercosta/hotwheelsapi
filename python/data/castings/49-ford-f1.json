The first generation, introduced in 1948 and also known as the Bonus-Built series, marked a divergence between truck and car design, using a chassis designed specifically for truck use. The series was available in a number of different configurations, such as panel vans and cowled chassis. The truck was also assembled as the Mercury M-Series in an attempt to extend dealership coverage in rural areas. For 1949 a defroster was added as an option. Production of the first generation ended in 1952.",
