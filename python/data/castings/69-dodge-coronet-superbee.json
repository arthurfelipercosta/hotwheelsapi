The fifth generation, styled by Virgil Exner and Elwood Engel, was introduced after a hiatus in Coronet production since 1959, with the car downsized from full-sized to intermediate-sized and built on the new Chrysler B-Body platform. The Super Bee trim level was introduced in 1968 as a companion model to the Plymouth Road Runner , mainly powered by a 426 ci (7.0L) Hemi V8. The A12 package was introduced in 1968 with a fiberglass hood with large hood scoop and various other decal packages. The Coronet was restyled in 1970 and discontinued the same year. 27,800 were produced for 1969.",
