        "en-us": "Skate Freaks was a short-lived series of miniature Hot Wheels vehicles produced in 2007. These represented people on skateboards, often featuring names referencing skate tricks. The series was a tie-in with Woodward Camp , a sport-themed summer camp based in Pennsylvania, with their branding featured prominently on the products of the line. Development of the series was overseen by Dave Sheltman who designed the associated launchers and skaters.",
