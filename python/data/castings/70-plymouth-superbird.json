Designed by Gary Romberg, the Superbird was developed specifically for NASCAR racing, being a follow-up design to the Dodge Charger Daytona introduced in 1969. It is one of four car described as \"Aero Warriors\", those being itself, the Dodge Charger Daytona, the Ford Torino Talladega and the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler . In comparison to the Road Runner it was based on, the car featured a smoother body profile, a lengthened body and an extremely large rear wing. NASCAR's homologation requirement required that the car must be available to the general public with at least 500 examples produced; ultimately the number of Superbirds produced would significantly exceed this number. Increasing emissions regulations, an insurance spike for high-performance cars and NASCAR effectively banning the aero car concept the Superbird was only produced in 1970. 1,933 were produced.
