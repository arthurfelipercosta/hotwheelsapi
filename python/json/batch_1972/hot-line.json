            "en-us": "Hot Line was a very short-lived series of motorized model trains using Sizzlers technology. These were produced in 1971 and were approximately 1/64 scale. The trains were able to run on Sizzlers-style track known as Railtrack and consisted of a futuristic high-speed train with some outlandish elements and a number of other cars to go alongside it. The trains were able to stop and go using buttons and were recharged using the Sizzlers Juice Machine or Power Pit with a special adapter. Despite sharing a similar name and using Hot Wheels-style technology this series was not officially branded as a Hot Wheels product although they were considered a Hot Wheels product in some material. Hot Wheels Railroad can be seen as sort of a spiritual successor to this series.",
