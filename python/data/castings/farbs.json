        "en-us": "Farbs (also formatted as FARBs ) was a very short-lived series of tongue-in-cheek vehicles produced in 1972. Advertised as \"Fantastic Car Kooks\", these were a series of cartoonish \"people\" cars, with people acting as the bodies and wheels attached to their arms and legs. The series was the brainchild of independent toy designer Eddy Goldfarb ; the series was named after Goldfarb as tribute. While the series was manufactured by Mattel and feature wheels also used on Hot Wheels products these were not officially branded as Hot Wheels products.",
