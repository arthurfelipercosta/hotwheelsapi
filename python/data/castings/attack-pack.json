        "en-us": "Attack Pack was a line of monstrous trucks and vehicles designed by Mike McKittrick and others released from 1992 to 1994 . The main gimmick of these vehicles was their transforming action when they were pressed down, causing them to open their mouths or perform other actions. They were even available as McDonalds Happy Meal toys, as an option to Barbie dolls. Several of the Attack Pack vehicles are easy to identify, since they are marked \"Attack Pack\", and some even \"Hot Wheels\" and also have a round symbol (except for the original series of cars and the repaints of those, and the Big Ones and Biggest Ones) with a hand doing a thumbs up or a scary face with fangs, representing the Heroic Cat Pack and Evil Rat Pack respectively. The series was later succeeded by the Road Beasts line.",
