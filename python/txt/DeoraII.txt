==Description==
'''Deora II''' is a modernized take on the [[Deora]] show car designed by [[Harry Bradley]]. Although it has the same trappings of the original Deora, such as a pair of surfboards and a two-seater cabin with a roof-hinged, front-mounted door, the Deora II is updated with a supercharged V8 and a swooping, curved body that contrasts the original Deora's sharp, angled lines. Comparisons can be drawn between the bubble-esque canopy and the rear of a third-generation Ford Taurus station wagon. 

The casting has been retooled twice; first in 2011, to greatly sink the windows into the frame, and then again in 2021, molding the previously detachable surfboards into the body. A similarly molded plastic retool had previously debuted in 2011, for [[Color Shifters]], although it maintains the original window position.  

Deora II starred as car #01 of the [[Highway 35 World Race|Highway 35]] anniversary event, driven by the Wave Rippers team leader Josef "Vert" Wheeler. The very same car would later go on to appear (and be destroyed) in [[Hot Wheels: AcceleRacers (film series)|AcceleRacers]]. Initially, this Deora II was rated at 400 horsepower with a 4.4 liter engine; by the time of AcceleRacers, these numbers had been increased to 750 horsepower and 5.0 liters.

==Show Car==
During the aforementioned 35th anniversary, the Deora II was built into a 1:1 scale show car. Mattel teamed up with [[wikipedia:Chip Foose|Chip Foose]], Five Axis Wheels, Mother's, and PPG Industries to create a life-sized rendition, which is powered by a transversely-mounted Cadillac NorthStar V8. In that same year, after debuting at the SEMA Show a week earlier, the Deora II was inducted into the [[Hall of Fame|Hot Wheels Hall of Fame]] at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles; [[wikipedia:Jay Leno|Jay Leno]] drove the car to the induction alongside [[Carson Lev]]. The show car has appeared in various places since; albeit having undergone modification from its launch; namely, new KMC Wheels replacing the Foose one-offs that matched Proch's original design, and in 2023, a new paint job themed after the car's depiction in AcceleRacers. It was repainted again in 2024 to match the car's appearance in ''[[Hot Wheels Let's Race]]'', replicating the car as found in the [[Wave Cravers 5-Pack]].

==Versions==
The '''Deora II''' has been released in the following 1/64 scale versions:
