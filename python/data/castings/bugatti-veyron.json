        "en-us": "The Bugatti Veyron is a French high-performance sports car manufactured by Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. from 2005 through 2014. Named for French motor racing driver Pierre Veyron, the Veyron is powered by a 8.0L quad-turbo W16 producing 1001 BHP, although subsequent versions tune the engine to more extreme levels. Production ended in 2014 with 450 produced. On introduction, the Veyron was one of the most expensive cars on sale at €1.7 million and also the fastest; a version of the Veyron has been verified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's fastest car, clocking a speed of 267.856 mph (431.072 km/h).\n\nWhile similar to the Bugatti Veyron casting, this casting features side mirrors, the front grille integrated into the body as opposed to the base, windshield wipers and a different engine sculpt, although it does feature a largely similar interior piece. Parts from both models will not interchange.",
